There is no proven treatment for Alport syndrome, although\\n      studies in animals have suggested several promising potential therapies. Potential drug\\n      treatments that might delay or prevent the development of kidney failure exist, but need to\\n      be evaluated through clinical trails.

Recruitment of participants for the registry will consist of three\\n      approaches.

        "briefDesc": "Over the past 30 years much has been learned about the molecular genetics and natural\n      history of familial forms of hematuria. However, the enhanced understanding of these\n      conditions has yet to generate effective therapies for Alport syndrome, the form of familial\n      hematuria associated with end-stage renal disease. Males with Alport syndrome inevitably\n      develop end-stage kidney failure, with a 50% likelihood of dialysis or kidney\n      transplantation by age 25 years.  There is no proven treatment for Alport syndrome, although\n      studies in animals have suggested several promising potential therapies. Potential drug\n      treatments that might delay or prevent the development of kidney failure exist, but need to\n      be evaluated through clinical trails. Conducting clinical trails for proposed treatments for\n      Alport syndrome present many challenges. Because Alport syndrome is not a common disease,\n      informative clinical trials will require the collaboration of investigators at multiple\n      centers.\n\n      The University of Minnesota, Department of Pediatrics, proposes to create the Alport\n      Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR) in order to facilitate clinical trials for\n      the treatment of Alport Syndrome. This registry will be the first of its kind in North\n      America. Because Alport syndrome is a rare disorder, recruitment of sufficient participants\n      for meaningful therapeutic trials will require a multicenter effort. The primary objective\n      of establishing and sustaining this registry is to enable clinical natural history studies\n      and therapeutic trials to be conducted in children and adolescents with Alport syndrome.",
        "longDesc": "Detailed Description:\n\n      ASTOR is envisioned as a permanent organization sustained by private philanthropic and\n      public funding sources. Recruitment of participants for the registry will consist of three\n      approaches.  First, pediatric nephrologists in the United States and Canada will be invited\n      to participate in ASTOR.  Activities of participating investigators will include\n      identification and recruitment of potential study participants, collection and transmission\n      of participant data to the ASTOR central office at the University of Minnesota, and\n      implementation of study protocols.\n\n      Participating physicians will inform their participants and parents about ASTOR and invite\n      them to participate in writing. The correspondence will include instructions on how to\n      contact ASTOR personal about formal participation. Participants and their parents will be\n      asked to permit sharing of their personal health information with the ASTOR central office.\n\n      Second, the ASTOR central office will develop a website for participants and families. The\n      website will provide participants and families with medical and new research information and\n      instructions on how to contact registry staff about registry participation. Potential\n      participants who contact the central office will be asked to give consent for ASTOR staff to\n      contact their health care providers.\n\n      Third, the University of Utah School of Medicine's Department of Nephrology, currently holds\n      data pertaining to approximately 350 families with a reported history of Alport syndrome.\n      Department investigators have agreed to provide information that will ultimately assist\n      ASTOR staff in executing recruitment activities by providing historical medical health\n      information pertaining the natural progression of the disease and current treatment\n      practices and by contacting patients in the existing database to determine if any\n      individuals or families are interested in participating in the registry. This information\n      will be used to support analysis efforts that may come about as a result of new studies that\n      are developed or implemented under the aegis of the registry. \n\n      Selection and Enrollment of Participants\n\n      Each consented participant will be assigned a unique identifier and entered into the ASTOR\n      database, along with demographic data, health information and urine analysis results.\n      Referring physicians and their home institutions will also be assigned unique identifiers.\n\n      ASTOR coordinator will contact each participant's physician and provide instructions on how\n      to complete a detailed baseline questionnaire designed to capture the following information:\n\n      Family history\n\n        -  X-chromosomal inheritance\n\n        -  Autosomal inheritance\n\n        -  Mode of inheritance unknown\n\n        -  Mode of inheritance known: Which person of your family is/was effected (or indicate in\n           family tree), which symptoms (hearing defect, ocular abnormalities, renal disease,\n           leiomyomatosis)?\n\n        -  At what age was the diagnosis Alport syndrome was made in effected family members?\n\n        -  If a family member had end stage renal failure, at what age?\n\n      Individual data of treated participant\n\n        -  At what age the diagnosis of Alport syndrome was made?\n\n        -  Has a skin biopsy been performed? If yes, list results.\n\n        -  Has a kidney biopsy been performed? If yes, list results.\n\n        -  Has a molecular-genetic diagnosis/ mutation analysis been performed?\n\n      Clinical data and progress of disease\n\n      • Medications and the age these meds were started\n\n      Recruitment of participants for the registry will consist of three approaches.  First,\n      pediatric nephrologists in the United States and Canada will be invited to participate in\n      the Alport Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR).  Activities of participating\n      investigators will include identification and recruitment of potential study participants,\n      collection and transmission of participant data to the ASTOR registry's central office at\n      the University of Minnesota. Second, the ASTOR central office will develop a website for\n      participants and families. The website will provide participants and families with medical\n      and new research information and instructions on how to contact registry staff about\n      registry participation. All policies and procedures for the information or samples that are\n      shared, stored or banked by the ASTOR central office will be prepared in accordance with the\n      University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology standard for securing private data\n      (see data safety monitoring plan). Urine samples will be collected by the ASTOR central\n      office. Instructions and materials for collecting and mailing the specimens will be provided\n      to each participant.  Third, the University of Utah will contact their existing patient base\n      to determine if any individuals or families are interested in participating in the registry\n      (IRB approval will be sought to contact potential participants).  Interested participants\n      will be referred to the ASTOR central office. Interested individuals and families will be\n      contacted in writing about formal participation.     \n\n      ASTOR central office staff will obtain informed consent form all participants (telephone\n      consent IRB approval pending). Participants will be seen every six months for assessments.\n      Clinical assessments will include an initial baseline questionnaire and urine sample\n      followed with bi-annual updates on medical and medication histories and urine analysis.\n\n      Medical and medication histories will be completed by the participant's provider and urine\n      samples will be forwarded by the participant to the University of Minnesota's central office\n      for testing. Contractual agreements  for the processing of all urine samples will be will be\n      established with an in-state laboratory .\n\n      Data Collection and Site Monitoring\n\n      Data to be Collected by Study Personnel:\n\n        1. Participant consent for the study (includes participant and parental consent,\n           participant assent when appropriate)\n\n        2. Baseline Questionnaire with bi annual medication and medical updates c. Baseline urine\n           sample repeated bi annually\n\n           Participant's medical and clinical data and urine analysis results will be submitted to\n           the ASTOR central office from multiple sources. Our goal is that all participants by 4\n           months would have complete study data (acknowledgement of consent, completed baseline\n           questionnaire and urine sample results) and data entry into an ASTOR central office\n           data base. Performance and completion of these components do not have participant or\n           participant safety implications.\n\n           • Data accuracy: For each participant, the data entered will match with the hard copy\n           of the questionnaire and lab and results.  Opportunities for error will be minimized by\n           the elimination of the need to re-copy data to multiple locations. Copies of all source\n           documents will be filed in double locked environments.\n\n           • Data Confidentiality: Every participant will be assigned a unique identifying\n           registry number.  These  unique participant identifiers will be kept within individual\n           participant folders. These participant folders are kept in files that are locked, with\n           only study specific personnel having access to them.\n\n           Participant data in computer databases are accessible only by study personnel require\n           and require a password. Participant specific information will not be included in\n           publications or in presentations at local or national meetings or conferences.\n\n           • Data Use: Registry participant data regarding medical history, urine analysis, and\n           demographic data will be used to define and categorize participants for future research\n           studies. Participant will be informed of the intended use and sign a formal consent to\n           participate in any future research endeavors that may be developed and implemented.\n\n           The database will also be useful in providing study personnel with the specific dates\n           for ensuing visits beginning with baseline and all subsequent bi-annual evaluations. No\n           one outside of immediate study staff will have access to the participant data, and\n           password protection is in place on each of the study computers to reduce the chance of\n           any breach in confidentiality.\n\n           There may be occasional requests from investigators outside the immediate study\n           personnel to share information. Information will be provided to investigators in\n           accordance with University of Minnesota Data Monitoring and Safety policies.",

          "",
          "Over the past 30 years much has been learned about the molecular genetics and natural\n      history of familial forms of hematuria. However, the enhanced understanding of these\n      conditions has yet to generate effective therapies for Alport syndrome, the form of familial\n      hematuria associated with end-stage renal disease. Males with Alport syndrome inevitably\n      develop end-stage kidney failure, with a 50% likelihood of dialysis or kidney\n      transplantation by age 25 years.  There is no proven treatment for Alport syndrome, although\n      studies in animals have suggested several promising potential therapies. Potential drug\n      treatments that might delay or prevent the development of kidney failure exist, but need to\n      be evaluated through clinical trails. Conducting clinical trails for proposed treatments for\n      Alport syndrome present many challenges. Because Alport syndrome is not a common disease,\n      informative clinical trials will require the collaboration of investigators at multiple\n      centers.\n\n      The University of Minnesota, Department of Pediatrics, proposes to create the Alport\n      Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR) in order to facilitate clinical trials for\n      the treatment of Alport Syndrome. This registry will be the first of its kind in North\n      America. Because Alport syndrome is a rare disorder, recruitment of sufficient participants\n      for meaningful therapeutic trials will require a multicenter effort. The primary objective\n      of establishing and sustaining this registry is to enable clinical natural history studies\n      and therapeutic trials to be conducted in children and adolescents with Alport syndrome.",
          "Detailed Description:\n\n      ASTOR is envisioned as a permanent organization sustained by private philanthropic and\n      public funding sources. Recruitment of participants for the registry will consist of three\n      approaches.  First, pediatric nephrologists in the United States and Canada will be invited\n      to participate in ASTOR.  Activities of participating investigators will include\n      identification and recruitment of potential study participants, collection and transmission\n      of participant data to the ASTOR central office at the University of Minnesota, and\n      implementation of study protocols.\n\n      Participating physicians will inform their participants and parents about ASTOR and invite\n      them to participate in writing. The correspondence will include instructions on how to\n      contact ASTOR personal about formal participation. Participants and their parents will be\n      asked to permit sharing of their personal health information with the ASTOR central office.\n\n      Second, the ASTOR central office will develop a website for participants and families. The\n      website will provide participants and families with medical and new research information and\n      instructions on how to contact registry staff about registry participation. Potential\n      participants who contact the central office will be asked to give consent for ASTOR staff to\n      contact their health care providers.\n\n      Third, the University of Utah School of Medicine's Department of Nephrology, currently holds\n      data pertaining to approximately 350 families with a reported history of Alport syndrome.\n      Department investigators have agreed to provide information that will ultimately assist\n      ASTOR staff in executing recruitment activities by providing historical medical health\n      information pertaining the natural progression of the disease and current treatment\n      practices and by contacting patients in the existing database to determine if any\n      individuals or families are interested in participating in the registry. This information\n      will be used to support analysis efforts that may come about as a result of new studies that\n      are developed or implemented under the aegis of the registry. \n\n      Selection and Enrollment of Participants\n\n      Each consented participant will be assigned a unique identifier and entered into the ASTOR\n      database, along with demographic data, health information and urine analysis results.\n      Referring physicians and their home institutions will also be assigned unique identifiers.\n\n      ASTOR coordinator will contact each participant's physician and provide instructions on how\n      to complete a detailed baseline questionnaire designed to capture the following information:\n\n      Family history\n\n        -  X-chromosomal inheritance\n\n        -  Autosomal inheritance\n\n        -  Mode of inheritance unknown\n\n        -  Mode of inheritance known: Which person of your family is/was effected (or indicate in\n           family tree), which symptoms (hearing defect, ocular abnormalities, renal disease,\n           leiomyomatosis)?\n\n        -  At what age was the diagnosis Alport syndrome was made in effected family members?\n\n        -  If a family member had end stage renal failure, at what age?\n\n      Individual data of treated participant\n\n        -  At what age the diagnosis of Alport syndrome was made?\n\n        -  Has a skin biopsy been performed? If yes, list results.\n\n        -  Has a kidney biopsy been performed? If yes, list results.\n\n        -  Has a molecular-genetic diagnosis/ mutation analysis been performed?\n\n      Clinical data and progress of disease\n\n      • Medications and the age these meds were started\n\n      Recruitment of participants for the registry will consist of three approaches.  First,\n      pediatric nephrologists in the United States and Canada will be invited to participate in\n      the Alport Syndrome Treatments and Outcomes Registry (ASTOR).

Second, the ASTOR central office will develop a website for\n      participants and families. The website will provide participants and families with medical\n      and new research information and instructions on how to contact registry staff about\n      registry participation. All policies and procedures for the information or samples that are\n      shared, stored or banked by the ASTOR central office will be prepared in accordance with the\n      University of Minnesota Office of Information Technology standard for securing private data\n      (see data safety monitoring plan). Urine samples will be collected by the ASTOR central\n      office. Instructions and materials for collecting and mailing the specimens will be provided\n      to each participant.  Third, the University of Utah will contact their existing patient base\n      to determine if any individuals or families are interested in participating in the registry\n      (IRB approval will be sought to contact potential participants).  Interested participants\n      will be referred to the ASTOR central office.

Patients with physician-diagnosed idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis enroll in the registry with inclusion criteria for diagnosis following ATS guidelines using clinical presentation, HRCT and/or surgical lung biopsy (AJRCCM 2011;183:788-824). The GAP index accounts for the patients gender (G), age (A), and lung function using lung physiology (P) variables FVC and DLCO.

However,\\n      the peak prevalence of migraine is in women of childbearing age.  This, coupled with the\\n      sporadic nature of migraine attacks and high rates of unplanned pregnancies, makes\\n      unintentional exposure to anti-migraine medications during pregnancy likely.   Prior to an\\n      anti-migraine medication being marketed there are few data available on drug safety in\\n      pregnancy: data from animal models may not translate directly to humans and pregnant women\\n      are routinely excluded from clinical trials.  The Sumatriptan Pregnancy Registry was\\n      established by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in 1996 to monitor the safety of sumatriptan during\\n      pregnancy.  It was combined with the Naratriptan Pregnancy Registry in 2001 and data\\n      collection on the sumatriptan-naproxen combination (Treximet) began in 2008.\",\"longDesc\":\"The Sumatriptan, Naratriptan and Treximet Pregnancy Registry aims to assess whether there is\\n      a substantial increase in the risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) following in\\n      utero exposure to those anti-migraine medications.  Exposure during the first trimester is\\n      of primary interest as this represents the period of organogenesis.\\n\\n      The Registry is a primarily prospective enrolment and follow-up study.  Patients exposed to\\n      sumatriptan, naratriptan, or the sumatriptan-naproxen combination during pregnancy, are\\n      enrolled, on a voluntary basis, by their healthcare provider.  Enrolment is encouraged early\\n      in pregnancy and if possible prior to any prenatal testing.  The healthcare provider\\n      provides initial information concerning patient demographics; details of the pregnancy\\n      including the estimated delivery date and results of any prenatal testing; and the timing,\\n      dosage, route of delivery (e.g. oral, subcutaneous, intranasal) of drug exposure in\\n      pregnancy.   The registry accepts exposure reports from anywhere in the world.  Within the\\n      United States (US) the healthcare provider can contact the registry using a toll free\\n      number.  Outside of the US enrolments are made through the GlaxoSmithKline local operating\\n      company.\\n\\n      Close to the estimated date of delivery the healthcare provider is contacted by the Registry\\n      to provide follow up information concerning the pregnancy outcome (live or still birth,\\n      spontaneous or induced abortion), the presence or absence of a MCM, and the history of\\n      headache and exposure to sumatriptan, naratriptan or the sumatriptan-naproxen combination\\n      during pregnancy.  Up to six attempts are made to contact the healthcare provider to obtain\\n      pregnancy outcome information.  After six attempts, the record is closed as lost to follow\\n      up.\\n\\n      Pregnancy outcomes are classified as outcomes with MCMs, outcomes without MCMs and\\n      spontaneous abortions.  The outcomes with and without MCMs are further classified as live\\n      births, stillbirths/fetal deaths and induced abortions.  Spontaneous abortions are reported\\n      separately due to potential for inconsistent identification of malformations in that\\n      situation.\\n\\n      It is beyond the scope of the Registry to consistently access pediatric evaluations and\\n      medical records.  For this reason the main outcome is restricted to major congenital\\n      malformations that are external and recognizable in the delivery room or shortly after\\n      birth.  To provide consistency, reported congenital malformations are classified as major or\\n      minor according to criteria used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s\\n      Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP).  All malformation reports are\\n      reviewed and classified by a paediatrician from the CDC and further information is requested\\n      as necessary.\\n\\n      Analyses are restricted to prospectively enrolled pregnancies (enrolment prior to knowledge\\n      of the birth outcome).

Patients exposed to\n      sumatriptan, naratriptan, or the sumatriptan-naproxen combination during pregnancy, are\n      enrolled, on a voluntary basis, by their healthcare provider.  Enrolment is encouraged early\n      in pregnancy and if possible prior to any prenatal testing.  The healthcare provider\n      provides initial information concerning patient demographics; details of the pregnancy\n      including the estimated delivery date and results of any prenatal testing; and the timing,\n      dosage, route of delivery (e.g. oral, subcutaneous, intranasal) of drug exposure in\n      pregnancy.   The registry accepts exposure reports from anywhere in the world.  Within the\n      United States (US) the healthcare provider can contact the registry using a toll free\n      number.  Outside of the US enrolments are made through the GlaxoSmithKline local operating\n      company.\n\n      Close to the estimated date of delivery the healthcare provider is contacted by the Registry\n      to provide follow up information concerning the pregnancy outcome (live or still birth,\n      spontaneous or induced abortion), the presence or absence of a MCM, and the history of\n      headache and exposure to sumatriptan, naratriptan or the sumatriptan-naproxen combination\n      during pregnancy.  Up to six attempts are made to contact the healthcare provider to obtain\n      pregnancy outcome information.  After six attempts, the record is closed as lost to follow\n      up.\n\n      Pregnancy outcomes are classified as outcomes with MCMs, outcomes without MCMs and\n      spontaneous abortions.  The outcomes with and without MCMs are further classified as live\n      births, stillbirths/fetal deaths and induced abortions.  Spontaneous abortions are reported\n      separately due to potential for inconsistent identification of malformations in that\n      situation.\n\n      It is beyond the scope of the Registry to consistently access pediatric evaluations and\n      medical records.  For this reason the main outcome is restricted to major congenital\n      malformations that are external and recognizable in the delivery room or shortly after\n      birth.  To provide consistency, reported congenital malformations are classified as major or\n      minor according to criteria used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s\n      Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program (MACDP).  All malformation reports are\n      reviewed and classified by a paediatrician from the CDC and further information is requested\n      as necessary.\n\n      Analyses are restricted to prospectively enrolled pregnancies (enrolment prior to knowledge\n      of the birth outcome).  Retrospectively enrolled pregnancies are reviewed for patterns of\n      malformation types, but are not included in formal analyses as retrospective reporting can\n      be biased towards more unusual and severe outcomes and are less likely to be representative\n      of the general population experience.\n\n      The proportion of infants with MCMs among prospectively reported exposures is calculated as:\n      the total number of outcomes with major birth defects (number of outcomes with major birth\n      defects + the number of live births without defects).\n\n      All spontaneous pregnancy losses, as well as induced abortions and fetal deaths without\n      reported defects, are excluded from the denominator due to the potential for inconsistent\n      identification of malformations in those situations.  The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for\n      risk estimates are calculated using exact methods based on the binomial distribution.\n\n      Analyses are stratified according to trimester of exposure (with the second trimester\n      starting at week 14 and the third trimester at week 28 of gestation) for each anti-migraine\n      of interest.  If an individual is exposed to multiple drugs of interest during pregnancy,\n      the exposure is included in analyses for each drug of interest.\n\n      The registry does not have an internal comparator group, but descriptive comparisons are\n      made with MCM rates from general population studies in the literature.\n\n      Prospective reports are also reviewed to detect any unusual patterns of malformation types\n      that may warrant further investigation.\n\n      The data from the Sumatriptan, Naratriptan and Treximet Pregnancy Registry are reviewed, and\n      conclusions developed, by an independent scientific advisory committee.

The purpose of the APR is to detect\\n      any major teratogenic effects involving any of the Registry drugs when administered to\\n      pregnant HIV positive women.  The Registry is intended to provide an early signal of\\n      teratogenicity associated with prenatal use of the antiretroviral drugs. The Registry\\n      collects data on prenatal exposures to antiretroviral drugs, potential confounding factors\\n      (such as maternal age, disease status during pregnancy), and information about the outcome\\n      of the pregnancy.\\n\\n      The Registry is managed by Kendle International Inc.  The scientific conduct and analysis of\\n      the Registry data are overseen by an independent Advisory Committee consisting of members\\n      from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration\\n      (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the academic sector.  Registry data are\\n      obtained from participating providers who encompass physicians in private practice as well\\n      as hospitals and community clinics.\\n\\n      The registry is co-sponsored and co-funded by 16 pharmaceutical companies that manufacture\\n      drugs used in ART.\",\"longDesc\":\"The Registry conforms to the FDA Guidance for Industry: Establishing Pregnancy Exposure\\n      Registries, the Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices, and the FDA Guidance on\\n      Pharmacovigilance.\\n\\n      The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry collects data on use of the following GSK drugs:\\n      abacavir, amprenavir, delavirdine, fosamprenavir, lamivudine, maraviroc, zidovudine, and\\n      their combinations during pregnancy.  The Registry requests information from medical\\n      providers about antiretroviral therapy, though there may be other drug exposures, which are\\n      not systematically collected.\\n\\n      Registration is voluntary.  Health professionals are strongly encouraged to enroll their\\n      antiretroviral-exposed pregnant patients into the Registry as early in the pregnancy as\\n      possible, preferably before prenatal testing is done. This is to maximize the data validity\\n      by minimizing potential biases introduced when a woman is enrolled after prenatal testing.\\n\\n      Patients are followed through health care providers who provide information on maternal risk\\n      factors, pregnancy outcome, and neonatal health.  In the month of expected delivery, a short\\n      follow-up form is sent to the health care provider to ascertain the pregnancy outcome and\\n      completion of the antiviral therapy information.  Additional follow-up is not sought from\\n      health care providers.\\n\\n      In an attempt to limit the bias in the analysis, the Registry assembled a group of providers\\n      who committed in writing to report every woman who receives antiretroviral therapy during\\n      pregnancy, but before the pregnancy outcome is known, that comes to their site.  This allows\\n      the Registry to include every report from that site as an evaluable case.  As the number of\\n      cases from these sites increases, the Registry will be able to analyze those cases\\n      separately.
